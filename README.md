# PortSwigger Labs Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various labs from the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security). The goal is to practice and document different web security vulnerabilities in a legal and controlled environment.

Each folder includes the lab name, a short explanation, and steps I followed to solve it.
